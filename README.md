# KISSMYLASHESZ
## Description
I built this app for KISSMYLASHESZ to provide a seamless and convenient online experience for both their existing clients and potential customers. By creating a user-friendly platform that prioritizes mobile accessibility, I aimed to enhance their online presence and showcase their expertise in lash extensions. Additionally, the app offers advanced training programs, empowering individuals who aspire to become lash technicians. Through this project, I sought to combine my passion for web development with the opportunity to support a family member's business and establish myself in the industry.
