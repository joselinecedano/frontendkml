              § You must have at least 50% of your lashes left,
otherwise you'll be charged a full set.<br/> § Fill is need to be booked within a 2-3 week period, anything after will be considered a full set. <br/> § After 4 weeks a majority of remaining lashes will be extremely outgrown and need a removal. If this hasn't been booked in prior, I may not be able to complete a
fullset within your allocated slot. <br/>§ I don't infill other lash tech's work. You would need
to book in for a removal and a fresh set.<br/>§ Every fill in comes with a complimentary lash bath. If your lash extensions have any lash strip glue on them, it will be an automatic <span  className='text-red-500'>lash removal</span>.
