              ยง You must have at least 50% of your lashes left,
otherwise you'll be charged a full set.<br/> ยง Fill is need to be booked within a 2-3 week period, anything after will be considered a full set. <br/> ยง After 4 weeks a majority of remaining lashes will be extremely outgrown and need a removal. If this hasn't been booked in prior, I may not be able to complete a
fullset within your allocated slot. <br/>ยง I don't infill other lash tech's work. You would need
to book in for a removal and a fresh set.
